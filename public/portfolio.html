                            <p>This is my machine learning project that i create with 4 of my friends using random forest. This project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify the presence of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) based on various health parameters.
                                The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle, specifically the Cardiovascular Disease dataset. The dataset contains information about patients' health metrics and whether they have CVD or not.</p>

                            <p>This is my deep learning project that i create with 2 of my friends using various speech-to-text models and NLP. The models that have been used includes Wav2Vec2, Whisper, and SR Lib for the text-to-speech and also BERT for NLP specifically for categorical Classification.
                                This project aims to create a system where users can schedule an activity into a calendar using voice commands and/or typing and labelled with specific activity categories.</p>
